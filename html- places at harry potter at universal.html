        <h3> Hi! This is just a seperate page I made to put in a list and photos of some things that I really liked at the Harry Potter section of Universal Studios.</h2>
        <ol>
            <li> Ollivander's Wand Shop
                <li> Honeydukes
                    <li>Try Butterbeer</li>
        </ol>
        <p> If you are a Harry Potter fan you must try going to Ollivander's Wand Shop. There you can buy your own wand of a character in Harry Potter, or a special collector's wand. Inside the box, if there is a map inside that means that your wand can do spells around the places that the map has numbers on. Some of the things that happen when you a spell is fire comes out of a chimney, a quill starts writing in a book, and lots more! At Honeydukes there are lots of different things. Like a chocolate frog, Felix Felicis or more commonly know as liquid luck. This is not a place but a drink that many Harry Potter fans have drank at Universal Studios. You should know this if you have watched or read the Harry Potter series. It is the drink called Butterbeer. The Golden Trio (Harry, Hermione, and Ron) are found drinking it at Diagon Ally. But if you go around the Harry Potter section at Universal Studios, you will find people with carts that make Butterbeer. There will be hot or cold but you can chose whatever you want. (Personally I think it is pretty sweet so I recommend not eating too much or eating it with someone else. Cause me, my sister, and my mom (well she only took a few sips) drank it all together and it was still a lot.)</p>

        <h2> Gilory Gardens </h2>
        <p> Gilory Gardens is a place where you can ride rides and play. It has lots of trees and is beautiful at night. There there are many rides but one of my personal favorites is one called the banana split. It is very much like the viking exept that the shape is a banana instead of a viking ship. Also for people who enjoy ice skating, there is a rink there for people who want to ice skate. If you do not have any ice skates on you there is a place where you can borrow them and use them to ice skate. if you do not know how to skate on your own there are cones that you can hole onto while you skate. There will be pictures on the botttom. </p>

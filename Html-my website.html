        <h2> What my website is like </h2>
        <p> Hi! I am Annabelle. <br> <u>In this website you can talk about what places that you have went to. And you can write about what places there that you recommend others should vist too. </u>For some examples I will write about 2 rides that I enjoyed riding. One is called The Flight of the Hippogriff. It is at Universal Studios, where all the Harry Potter rides and things are. Another I will talk about is at Great America, and it is called the rushin river. I will also be lating about different places at Universal Studios, and a place called Gilory Garden. </p>

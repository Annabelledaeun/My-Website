        <h2> Great America's water park </h2>
        <p> The Rushin River is in Great America, which has many rides, and a whole separate section as a water park. The Rushin River is where you ride on a circular tube. If you want to have a life jacket there are ones there that you can ride on. There are parts in the river where they spray water from the top, but if you want to avoid them you can just go to the places where the water doesn't reach. The water is not very deep so most people should be able to touch the floor. Everyone of all ages have gone on this ride. It is a fun ride for kids, adults, most everyone. Another is a pool that goes till 6 feet with a places with chairs for anyone that wants to sit or leave their stuff there. <em >After a</em> <b>BEEP</b> <em>sound there are going to be waves!!</em></p>
